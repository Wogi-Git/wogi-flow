Compare auto-generated index with curated app-map and suggest updates.

Usage: `/wogi-map-sync`

## What It Does

1. Reads `component-index.json` (auto-generated)
2. Reads `app-map.md` (curated)
3. Finds discrepancies:
   - In codebase but NOT in app-map → suggest adding
   - In app-map but NOT in codebase → may be stale
4. Offers to update app-map

## Output

```
