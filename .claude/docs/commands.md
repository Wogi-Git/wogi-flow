Complete reference for all slash commands and CLI commands.

## Slash Commands

When user types these commands, execute the corresponding action immediately.

### Task Management

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `/wogi-ready` | Read `ready.json`, show tasks organized by status (ready, in progress, blocked). Summarize what's available to work on. |

| `/wogi-done [id]` | Manual completion (optional). Check quality gates, update ready.json, commit. Usually not needed since `/wogi-start` auto-completes. |
| `/wogi-bulk` | Execute multiple tasks in sequence. Order by dependencies + priority. Follow all Task Execution Rules for each. Compact between tasks. Options: number, task IDs, --auto, --plan. |
| `/wogi-status` | Show project overview: task counts, active features, bugs, component count, git status, recent request-log entries. |
| `/wogi-deps [id]` | Find the task in tasks.json, show what it depends on and what depends on it. |

## Command Execution

When user types a slash command:
1. Parse the command and arguments
2. Execute the action (read files, update state, etc.)
3. Provide clear output
4. If command modifies files, log to request-log if appropriate

Example:
```
User: /wogi-ready
Agent:
📋 **Task Queue**

**Ready (3)**
• TASK-012: Add forgot password link [High]
• TASK-015: User profile page [Medium]
• TASK-018: Settings modal [Low]

**In Progress (1)**
• TASK-011: Login form validation

**Blocked (1)**
• TASK-020: Email notifications (waiting on TASK-019)

Recommend starting with TASK-012 (high priority, no dependencies).
```
