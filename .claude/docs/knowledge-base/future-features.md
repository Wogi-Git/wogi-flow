# Future Features

Planned and considered features for Wogi-Flow.

---

## Status Legend

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Planned** | Will be implemented |
| **Backlog** | On request or when needed |
| **Considering** | Under evaluation |
| **Skipped** | Not planning to implement |

---

## Planned Features

### Team Observability Dashboard

**Status**: Planned (with team tier launch)

Web UI for team-wide visibility:
- All runs with status
- Per-step spans with inputs/outputs
- Retry history and failure context
- Team-wide task dashboard
- Role-based access (admin, lead, member)

**Trigger**: Team tier launch with hosted database

---

### Enhanced Model Stats

**Status**: Planned

Track detailed success metrics per model:

```json
{
  "ollama-qwen": {
    "successRate": 0.87,
    "avgLatencyMs": 4500,
    "failuresByCategory": {
      "import_error": 12,
      "type_error": 5
    },
    "byTaskType": {
      "create-component": { "success": 45, "fail": 3 },
      "fix-bug": { "success": 22, "fail": 8 }
    }
  }
}
```

**Trigger**: Users asking "which model is best for X?"

---

### Tiered Learning Thresholds

**Status**: Planned

Smarter auto-application of learned patterns:

```javascript
const LEARNING_TIERS = {
  AUTO_APPLY: { minSuccessRate: 0.9, minSamples: 5 },
  APPLY_WITH_LOG: { minSuccessRate: 0.7, minSamples: 3 },
  QUEUE_FOR_REVIEW: { minSuccessRate: 0, minSamples: 0 }
};
```

**Trigger**: Model adapter needs smarter auto-apply logic

---

## Backlog Features

### Jira/Linear Integration

**Status**: Backlog

Sync tasks with external project management tools:

```json
{
  "integrations": {
    "jira": {
      "enabled": false,
      "baseUrl": "https://company.atlassian.net",
      "projectKey": "PROJ"
    },
    "linear": {
      "enabled": false,
      "apiKey": "$LINEAR_API_KEY",
      "teamId": "TEAM-123"
    }
  }
}
```

Commands:
- `/wogi-external-tasks` - List assigned tasks
- `/wogi-external-tasks PROJ-123` - Import specific task

**Trigger**: Users request project management integration
**Effort**: 1-2 days per integration

---

### Cascade Fallback

**Status**: Backlog

If primary model fails 3x on same error, try alternate model:

```json
{
  "cascade": {
    "enabled": false,
    "fallbackModel": null,
    "maxFailuresBeforeEscalate": 3,
    "escalateOnCategories": ["capability_mismatch", "context_overflow"]
  }
}
```

**Trigger**: Users with multiple models reporting "stuck on same error"
**Requires**: Users with multiple models configured

---

### Quality Gate Confidence

**Status**: Backlog

Don't apply low-confidence changes automatically:

```javascript
const confidenceMarkers = {
  high: ["I'm confident", "This will work", "Straightforward"],
  low: ["I think", "might work", "not entirely sure"]
};
```

**Trigger**: When bad outputs are frequently applied

---

### Context Priority Scoring

**Status**: Backlog

Smarter context selection than "include everything":

```javascript
const CONTEXT_PRIORITIES = {
  required_types: 1.0,      // Always include
  target_file: 0.95,        // Almost always
  related_imports: 0.8,     // Usually helpful
  patterns: 0.7,            // Good to have
  examples: 0.5,            // Nice to have
  full_files: 0.3           // Only if space
};
```

**Trigger**: If context overflow becomes common

---

### Formalized Model Registry

**Status**: Backlog

Structured capability definitions per model:

```json
{
  "models": {
    "gpt-4o-mini": {
      "provider": "openai",
      "contextWindow": 128000,
      "costTier": "cheap",
      "capabilities": ["code-generation", "structured-output"],
      "structuredOutputReliability": "high"
    }
  }
}
```

**Trigger**: When supporting 5+ executor models

---

## Multi-Model Features

Only implement if users have 3+ models configured.

### Multi-Model Orchestration

**Status**: Considering

Route different tasks to optimal models:

```json
{
  "modelRouting": {
    "orchestration": "claude-opus",
    "exploration": "claude-haiku",
    "frontend": "gemini-pro",
    "debugging": "gpt-5",
    "documentation": "claude-sonnet"
  }
}
```

**Trigger**: Users want to optimize cost/quality tradeoffs
**Risk**: Complexity, API key management, cost tracking

---

### Task Router

**Status**: Backlog

Automatically route task types to best models.

**Trigger**: Users with 3+ models asking for routing
**Risk**: Over-engineering for single-model users

---

### Parallel Dispatch

**Status**: Backlog

Execute independent subtasks on multiple models simultaneously.

**Trigger**: Users request parallel execution for speed
**Risk**: Complexity for unclear gain

---

### Background Sync Daemon

**Status**: Backlog

Keep state in sync across multiple agent branches:

```javascript
const daemon = {
  watchPaths: ['.workflow/state/'],
  syncOnChange: true,
  syncOnBranchSwitch: true,
  heartbeatMs: 5000
};
```

**Trigger**: Users report stale data when switching agent contexts
**Risk**: Over-engineering for single-agent workflows

---

## Skipped Features

We're skeptical these add value without strong evidence.

### Structured JSON Contract

**Why Skipped**: Local LLMs can't reliably produce JSON
**Would Reconsider If**: New models achieve 95%+ JSON reliability
**Current Solution**: `flow-response-parser.js` handles messy output

---

### SQLite Telemetry

**Why Skipped**: JSON files work fine for 50 runs/day
**Would Reconsider If**: Users need complex queries across runs
**Concerns**: Native dependency, not human-readable, overkill

---

### Prompt Fragment System

**Why Skipped**: Current Handlebars templates work fine
**Would Reconsider If**: Templates become unmanageable (20+)

---

| Git Hooks Setup | `flow-setup-hooks.js` for pre-commit automation |

---

## How This Backlog Works

1. **Review Quarterly**: Are users asking for any of these?
2. **Promote on Demand**: Move items up when users request them
3. **Delete if Stale**: Remove items no one asks about in 6 months
4. **Track Triggers**: Note what would make each feature valuable

---

## Requesting Features

To request a feature from this backlog:
1. Open an issue with use case
2. Describe the pain point
3. If compelling, feature gets promoted
