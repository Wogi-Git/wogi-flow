## Quick Start

### New Project
```bash
./scripts/flow install
```

### Existing Project
```bash
./scripts/flow onboard
```

### Start Working
```bash
/wogi-ready          # See available tasks
/wogi-start TASK-XXX # Start a task
```

## How This Knowledge Base Is Organized

Unlike feature-by-feature documentation, this knowledge base is organized by **purpose** - what you're trying to accomplish:

### 1. Setting Up (Once per project)
Everything in [01-setup-onboarding](./01-setup-onboarding/) helps you get Wogi-Flow configured for your project. This includes analyzing your codebase, populating decisions and component registries, and setting up team sync.

### 2. Executing Tasks (Daily workflow)
The [02-task-execution](./02-task-execution/) category is the heart of Wogi-Flow. It explains the entire execution pipeline from task selection through completion, including:
- Why task gating prevents incomplete work
- How loops ensure acceptance criteria are met
- Trade-offs between thoroughness and token consumption

### 3. Getting Smarter Over Time
[03-self-improvement](./03-self-improvement/) explains how Wogi-Flow learns from corrections and improves at four levels: project, skill, model, and team.

### 4. Managing Context & Memory
[04-memory-context](./04-memory-context/) addresses the biggest challenge in AI coding: context window limits and session persistence. These features prevent hallucinations and preserve history.

### 5. Accelerating Development
[05-development-tools](./05-development-tools/) covers additional tools that speed up specific workflows like design-to-code, understanding codebases, and voice input.

### 6. Staying Safe
[06-safety-guardrails](./06-safety-guardrails/) documents protections against mistakes, including pattern-based damage control, security scanning, and recovery systems.
