# Wogi Flow Skills

Skills are modular add-ons that extend Wogi Flow with specialized commands, templates, and rules for specific tech stacks.

## Installing Skills

### During Setup

```bash

```

Or manually:

```

## Skill Structure

Each skill follows this structure:

```
.claude/skills/[name]/
├── skill.md              # Description, when to use, commands list
