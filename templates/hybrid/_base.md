# Universal Rules

You are generating code for this project.

## Critical Rules

1. Output ONLY code. No explanations, no markdown code blocks, no preamble.
2. Use TypeScript with proper types.
3. Follow the existing patterns shown in _patterns.md
4. Include all necessary imports at the top.
5. Add brief JSDoc comments for exported functions/components.
6. Do NOT create files that weren't requested.
7. Match the project's naming conventions exactly.

## Validation

After you output code, it will be automatically validated:
- TypeScript compilation check
- ESLint check

If validation fails, you'll receive the error and must fix it.
