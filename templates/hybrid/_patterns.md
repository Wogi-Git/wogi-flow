# Project Patterns

This file will be auto-generated during onboarding based on your actual codebase patterns.

Run `./scripts/flow templates generate` to populate this file with real examples from your project.

## Naming Conventions

- Components: PascalCase (e.g., `UserProfile.tsx`)
- Hooks: camelCase with `use` prefix (e.g., `useAuth.ts`)
- Services: camelCase with `Service` suffix (e.g., `authService.ts`)
- Utilities: camelCase (e.g., `formatDate.ts`)
- Types/Interfaces: PascalCase (e.g., `UserProfile`, `AuthResponse`)

## Import Order

1. React/framework imports
2. Third-party libraries
3. Aliased imports (@/ or ~/)
4. Relative imports
5. Type imports (with `type` keyword)
