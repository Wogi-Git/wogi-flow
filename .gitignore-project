# Wogi Flow - Project .gitignore
# 
# USAGE: Copy relevant sections to your project's .gitignore
#
# RECOMMENDATION: Track .workflow/ in git so your team shares:
# - Task queue and history
# - Request log
# - Component map
# - Project decisions
#
# If you prefer NOT to track workflow state, uncomment the lines below.

# === OPTIONAL: Uncomment to exclude workflow state ===
# .workflow/state/
# .workflow/archive/
# .workflow/corrections/

# === NEVER track these (sensitive or temp) ===
# .workflow/state/components/*.secret
# .workflow/tests/flows/*.recording

# === Always safe to exclude ===
.workflow/tests/flows/*.tmp
.workflow/archive/*.bak

# === Hybrid mode cache files (auto-generated) ===
.workflow/state/export-map.json
.workflow/state/hybrid-context.md

# === Note ===
# The update command (./scripts/flow update) will NEVER overwrite:
# - .workflow/config.json (your settings)
# - .workflow/state/* (your project data)
# - .workflow/changes/* (your features)
# - .workflow/bugs/* (your bug reports)
# - .workflow/corrections/* (your correction reports)
# - .claude/rules/* (your custom rules)
# - .claude/skills/*/knowledge/learnings.md (your skill learnings)
